Automated Test Case Generation Tools using Symbolic Execution: SAGE, Pex, Mayhem

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Addressing Path Explosion}

Dealing with the path explosion problem: grammar-based whitebox fuzzing (abstracting inputs), MultiSE (merging states), using symbolic execution friendly primitives (OVerify), underconstrained execution (dealing with a single module at a time).

\subsection{Pruning}

\subsection{State Merging}

\subsection{Compositionality}

\subsection{Abstraction}

\subsection{Solver Optimizations}

Addressing the solver bottleneck: query caches, memory models (Mayhem only models symbolic reads)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Supporting Real-world Targets}

\subsection{System Software}

Handling real-world targets: C, C++ (KLOVER), parallel systems (explain the two ways to run these systems symbolically, depending on what bugs we're looking for).

Modeling the program environment: using the real environment, using abstractions.

\subsection{Interpreted Languages}

Jalangi for JavaScript using dynamic instrumentation.

Using the interpreter for symbolic execution: Lorenzo's paper (consider x86 as interpreted by Qemu or Bochs, then compare the two implementations to find bugs in the more complex one).

\subsection{Cooperating with the Symbolic Environment}

Cooperative symbolic execution (where the program uses special APIs of the engine).
