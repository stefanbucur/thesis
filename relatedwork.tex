There is substantial related work in the area of symbolic execution and formal methods in general.  In this chapter, we review the use of symbolic execution for automated test case generation (Section~\ref{sec:relwork:atcg}) and its applications on real-world software targets (Section~\ref{sec:relwork:targets}).  In particular, we focus on how previous work addressed the path explosion problem (Section~\ref{sec:relwork:pathexpl}).

\section{Overview of Automated Testing Using Symbolic Execution}

We review the most important symbolic execution-based tools.  The story is chronological, illustrating the advancements brought by each tool.

%% King~\cite{king:symbolic:2} described symbolic execution as a practical middle ground between testing a program with a set of concrete inputs and using formal correctness proofs.  The paper introduced EFFIGY, an interactive symbolic execution tool where developers manually step through paths and switch states in the execution tree.  However, the tool could only handle small programs written in a custom language supporting basic integer operations, and had limited performance, due to limited solver capabilities.

Symbolic execution was introduced almost four decades ago as a test case generation technique~\cite{king:symbolic:2, boyer:symbolic}.  The first tools that used symbolic execution worked on domain-specific languages, supported basic numeric operations, and had an interactive interface.  As a resource-intensive task, symbolic execution was severely limited by the lack of efficient decision procedures for the data types used in programs and slow hardware performance.

%% It was only in the past decade that symbolic execution has become a feasible approach to test generation for real-world software, with the advent of modern constraint solvers, such as Chaff~\cite{chaff}, MiniSAT~\cite{minisat}, STP~\cite{stp}, Z3~\cite{Z3}, or CVC~\cite{cvc}, and the exponential increase in hardware performance.  Our tools build on this foundation, too---both Cloud9 and Chef resort to the STP solver for all symbolic queries, such as branch feasibility checks.

The situation changed in the past decade, with the exponential increase in hardware performance, faster off-the-shelf constraint solvers~\cite{chaff,minisat,stp,Z3,cvc}, and modern decision procedures.
%
This enabled symbolic execution to target commonly used software written in languages such as C or Java, where it found bugs and generated high-coverage test suites.

\subsection{System-level Software}

%% \paragraph{DART}

%% DART automatically extracts the environment interface of a C program using static analysis.  DART augment the classic random fuzzing with a dynamic analysis that collects. The advantage of concrete execution is that DART can fall back on concrete semantics when symbolic ones are not supported (e.g., multiplications) DART detects standard errors such as crashes, assertion violations, and hangs.  Dart extracts the static interface of a program, consisting of global variables and inputs to the program entry function.  It concretizes calls to library functions.

%% Initializing values in DART: either randomly, or NULL or malloced values (for pointer types).  Chef and Cloud9 leaves it to the symbolic test the job of creating inputs. The basic primitives are marking allocated buffers (or integers or strings) as symbolic.

%% Dealing with environment inconsistencies in DART: Not a problem, as programs are re-executed (so no cross-talking in paths).  But assume no side effects in the program.

%% Solver in DART: lp\_solve (linear constraints of integers and reals).

%% DART was applied on C benchmarks and an implementation of the SIP protocol, finding hundreds of crashes.

%% DART uses DFS, BFS, or random.

%% \paragraph{CUTE}

%% Unit testing using concolic execution, with memory graphs as inputs.  Separates memory constraints from scalar constraints and keeps pointer constraints simple to keep the decision procedure tractable and efficient.

%% CUTE uses DFS.

%% CUTE uses its own in-house solver, built on top of lp\_solve, which adds optimizations such as incrementality.

%% CUTE supports generation of structured data by either calling sequences of operations, or solving data structure invariants (repOk operations), similar to Korat~\cite{boyapati:korat}.

%% Used for testing data structures.

Two of the challenges of a symbolic execution engine is providing support for all language features, and handling the execution outside the scope of the program.  To address this problem, DART~\cite{dart} and CUTE~\cite{cute} introduced the concept of concolic (concrete + symbolic) execution, where a concrete input drives a concrete execution through the program, while collecting symbolic constraints along the way.  The constraints were used to generate a new concrete input, and the program was re-executed.  Whenever the symbolic mode was not supported (e.g., unsupported operations or external library calls), the execution would fall back to concrete mode only.  The tools found crashes in C programs, such as protocol implementations and data structure libraries.

%% \paragraph{EXE}

%% Dedicated constraint solver STP, codesigned with EXE, optimized for reasoning about bitvectors and arrays, which accurately encode machine operations at good performance.

%% Has a flat view of memory.

%% Works by translating the C code to an instrumented format that includes checks for concrete/symbolic values, forks (UNIX forks), and checks for properties (memory errors, division by zero).

%% Introduced constraint optimization: caching, constraint independence.

%% DFS/BFS as search heuristics.

%% Found bugs in udhcpd, packet filters (BPF), pcre regexp library.


EXE~\cite{exe} further expanded the scope and scale of symbolic execution by relying on STP~\cite{stp}, an efficient constraint solver with dedicated support for bitvectors and arrays, theories that can accurately express machine operations in languages such as C.
%
This allowed EXE to have a flat symbolic representation of program memory, with support for arbitrary pointer and integer operations.
%
EXE found bugs in udhcpd, packet filters (BPF), and the pcre PERL regular expression library.

%% \paragraph{SAGE}~\cite{sage2012,godefroid:fuzz}

%% Used in production, during Windows development, found thousands of vulnerabilities.  Largest known deployment of symbolic execution in production.

%% Targeted large applications, binary-level.

%% Introduces the generational search heuristic for finding bugs more efficiently in an incomplete search.

SAGE~\cite{sage2012,godefroid:fuzz} is the most successful use of symbolic execution in production.  It relies on concolic execution done at binary (x86) level.  It targets large applications with deep execution paths, such as Windows format parses and Microsoft Office applications.  To effectively explore the large search space, SAGE introduced a generational search heuristic.  The idea is to start from a concrete input that takes the program down a relevant path (e.g., a valid Office document), then alternate all branches on that path, then do the same with the second-generation inputs (hence the ``whitebox fuzzing'' name).
%
SAGE found thousands of Windows vulnerabilities at development time.

%% \paragraph{KLEE}

%% Uses symbolic execution for testing real-world systems code (Coreutils, Hi-star kernel, Busybox).  They built a high-performance symbolic execution engine that finds bugs in highly tested code and achieves high coverage levels.
%% Compact state representation using COW.
%% Uses a high-performance SMT solver (STP), and optimizes interface to the solver (constraint caching, expression simplifications).
%% Handles the environment problem through a model of files (used by the Coreutils), and external calls into the host environment.
%% Handles C code by compiling and running LLVM.
%% Uses static heuristics to maximize coverage, plus standard strategies.
%% Command line interface for marking inputs symbolic.

To target systems of increasing complexity, symbolic execution engines needed to address the environment problem.
%
KLEE~\cite{klee} was the first symbolic execution engine to target system software that communicates with its environment.  KLEE provides robust support for complex system software by having the software compiled to LLVM~\cite{llvm} IR, which is then interpreted symbolically.
%
KLEE~\cite{klee} introduced environment models as approximations of the real OS interface: the models replace parts of the standard C library and provided support for files.
%
This resulted in KLEE uncovering crashes and generating test suites with over 90\% coverage on average in the popular Coreutils utilities (e.g., \codebit{ls}, \codebit{echo}), testing Busybox and an OS kernel.
%
Our Cloud9 system builds on top of KLEE, providing symbolic primtives for a large fraction of the POSIX interface, as well as adding support for parallel symbolic execution.

S2E~\cite{s2eSystem} enabled symbolic execution for arbitrary parts of a system, by running them in-vivo, inside a symbolic VM environment.  As the entire VM could potentially become symbolic, S2E provides consistency models, which are ways to specify how branching is limited outside the component of interest.  S2E found bugs in device drivers, thanks to support for symbolic hardware.
%
Chef builds on top of S2E.

%% \paragraph{AEG}~\cite{aeg}

%% Automated testing with the specific purpose of generating proofs of vulnerabilities (exploits), i.e., inputs that explicitly hijack the program control flow and get a shell.

%% Takes as input LLVM + binary, produces exploit.

%% Generated 16 exploits on 14 open-source projects.

%% Buggy path-first heuristic: When a path has a bug (unexploitable), it is likely that it'll exhibit more bugs that could be exploitable.

%% Loop exhaustion strategy: prioritize paths exploring maximum number of iterations.

%% Symbolic files: simplifies KLEE's interface.

%% Symbolic sockets: supplies fresh symbolic data.

%% Environment variables (concrete values, fully symbolic, failures).

%% Network, multithreading, formatting functions (about 70 system calls).  Not clear how sound the support is, nor what happens when a syscall is not supported.

%% \paragraph{Mayhem}~\cite{mayhem}

%% Finds 29 exploitable vulnerabilities in Linux and Windows programs.

%% System designed to handle efficiently (at the expense of completeness) large state spaces generated by large programs.  Efficient reasoning about symbolic memory (symbolic writes are concretized, symbolic reads are replaced with nested ite expressions).

%% Uses only binaries (no debug info needed).

%% \paragraph{Bitblaze}~\cite{bitBlaze}

%% Unified binary analysis platform, used mainly for malware analysis.


Symbolic execution is also useful for security testing~\cite{aeg,mayhem,bitBlaze}.  For this task, reaching vulnerabilities is more important than achieving completeness, so engines in this space resort to simplifications to increase performance and reach deeper executions in larger programs.
%
For example, the AEG~\cite{aeg} tool uses symbolic analysis to both find bugs and automatically generate exploits (get a shell) from the bugs.  AEG uses heuristics that prioritize buggt paths and employs simple operating system models that minimize path explosion.
%
The Mayhem~\cite{mayhem} tool employs a simplified symbolic memory model where write addresses are concretized.
%
Both tools found exploitable vulnerabilities in Linux and Windows programs.

Handling real-world targets: C, C++ (KLOVER), parallel systems (explain the two ways to run these systems symbolically, depending on what bugs we're looking for).

\subsection{VM Languages}

%% \paragraph{Java Path Finder}
%% \cite{jpf-symbex,jpf-testgen,generalized-symbex}.
%% Code that manipulates complex data structures.  Uses lazy initialization to instantiate data structures.
%% Built on top of the JVM.
%% Uses iterative deepening combined with DFS.
%% Model checking as a form of testing: since the program environment is typically way too large, model checking ends up being testing.
%% Can be used to either execute a repOk method and generate blackbox inputs, or do whitebox testing.

%% \paragraph{Pex}
%% Pex~\cite{tillmann-pex}.
%% Whitebox fuzzing for .NET.  Integrated in Visual Studio.  Found errors in a core .NET component.
%% Uses PUTs (parameterized unit tests)~\cite{tillmann-puts}.
%% Uses a ``meta-strategy'' that groups branches in equivalence classes, and then selects the lest chosen class.  Different sets of equivalence classes are chosen uniformly.
%% Constructing objects: run symbolically the object constructor.

Symbolic execution is also used for languages compiled to a virtual machine environment, such as Java or .NET~\cite{jpf-symbex,tillmann-pex}.  These languages pose additional challenges for symbolic execution, as they are object-oriented, so program inputs could also be structured data in addition to scalar values.
%
The Java PathFinder~\cite{visser-jpf,jpf-symbex,jpf-testgen} employs generalized symbolic execution~\cite{generalized-symbex} to handle symbolic objects.  The symbolic objects remain uninitialized until they are referenced in the code and lazily unfold in response to member access statements.

\subsection{Dynamic Interpreted Languages}

To our knowledge, no symbolic execution engine for Lua exists.  For Python, we found three research tools, which we compare \chef to.  (1) \cutiepy~\cite{cutie-py} is a concolic engine based on a formal model of the Python language.  It uses a custom CPython interpreter to drive a concrete execution, along with updating the symbolic state according to model semantics. (2) NICE-PySE~\cite{nice} is part of the NICE framework for testing OpenFlow applications.  We will refer to it as \nicese, for brevity. It wraps supported data types into symbolic counterparts that carry the symbolic store, and uses Python's tracing mechanisms to implement the interpretation loop fully in Python.  (3) The symbolic execution engine of the scalability testing tool Commuter~\cite{commuter} is also entirely built in Python.  Its primary purpose is the construction of models that explicitly use an API of symbolic data types.

Jalangi for JavaScript using dynamic instrumentation.

Using the interpreter for symbolic execution: Lorenzo's paper (consider x86 as interpreted by Qemu or Bochs, then compare the two implementations to find bugs in the more complex one).

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use symbolic execution on an interpreter to symbolically execute a program written in the target interpreted language.  However, there has been work on writing dedicated symbolic execution engines for interpreted languages directly.  Beside Python engines, the Kudzu~\cite{saxena-kudzu} symbolic execution engine for JavaScript was used to detect code injection vulnerabilities. It relies on an intermediate representation of JavaScript that it directly executes symbolically.
%
Apollo~\cite{artzi-apollo} is another engine targeting PHP code to detect runtime and HTML errors, while Ardilla~\cite{kiezun-ardilla} uses this system to discover SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks in PHP.

\section{Program Environment Support}

In order to efficiently achieve the testing goals for the target program, symbolic execution engines need to minimize the time spent in the environment, while ensuring correct behavior in the program.
%
The existing approaches fall into three categories: concretizing the calls into the environment, bundling the environment with the rest of the program, and abstracting (modeling) the environment.

Concretizing calls into the environment can be easily done in concolic mode, by simply dropping the symbolic operations while the execution carries outside the program [cite CUTE, DART, SAGE].  In pure symbolic mode, an alternative is to call the environment of the host [cite KLEE].  The disadvantage is that different execution paths can interfere for stateful calls (e.g., resource operations).

The opposite approach is to treat the program + environment as one large target.  Full-VM symbolic execution engines take this approach.  The problem is that path explosion in the entire system reduces the focus on the target program.  S2E introduced consistency models as a principled path pruning outside the module of interest.

The last approach is to replace a concrete interface implementation with a simplified one, as either part of the symbolic execution engine (e.g., symbolic hardware in S2E), or as guest code running at the same level as the target program (e.g., uClibc models in KLEE).  The simpler the model, the less path explosion, but may introduce unsoundness or missed bugs.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Path Explosion Mitigation}

Dealing with the path explosion problem: grammar-based whitebox fuzzing (abstracting inputs), MultiSE (merging states), using symbolic execution friendly primitives (OVerify), underconstrained execution (dealing with a single module at a time).

\subsection{Search Heuristics}

Group heuristics by their goals and their inputs (the state information they use).

Generational search in SAGE.

\subsection{Path Pruning}

Eliminate or deprioritize the paths are are less likely to lead to the exploration goal.  Goes hand in hand with prioritization heuristics.

Replace two states meeting in the CFG with one that combines the memory locations and path conditions of the two.  Doesn't lead to improvements all the time, due to increased solver overhead [cite Trevor Hansen's study].

Compositionality means executing symbolically individual functions and storing the disjunction of path conditions as a function summary.  Can be computed incrementally, in response to program executions [cite demand-driven].

\subsection{Improving Constraint Solving}

Addressing the solver bottleneck: query caches, memory models (Mayhem only models symbolic reads). Guarded sets in multiSE.

\subsection{Parallel Symbolic Execution}

Recently, \cite{parallelSymbex} described an extension to Java Pathfinder (JPF) that parallelizes symbolic execution by using parallel random searches on a static partition of the execution tree.  JPF pre-computes a set of disjoint constraints that, when used as preconditions on a worker's exploration of the execution tree, steer each worker to explore a subset of paths disjoint from all other workers.  In this approach, using constraints as preconditions imposes, at {\em every} branch in the program, a solving overhead relative to exploration without preconditions.  The complexity of these preconditions increases with the number of workers, as the preconditions need to be more selective.  Thus, per-worker solving overhead increases as more workers are added to the cluster.  This limits scalability: the largest evaluated program had 447 lines of code and did not interact with its environment.  Due to the {\em static} partitioning of the execution tree, total running time is determined by the worker with the largest subtree.  As a result, increasing the number of workers can even increase total test time instead of reducing it~\cite{parallelSymbex}.  \cnine mitigates these drawbacks.

Several sequential symbolic execution engines~\cite{godefroid:fuzz,dart,hct,klee} have had great success in automated testing. These state-of-the-art tools exhaust available memory and CPU fairly quickly.  \cnine can help such tools scale beyond their current limits, making symbolic execution a viable testing methodology for a wider spectrum of software systems.

\topic{To our knowledge, we are the first to scalably parallelize symbolic execution to shared-nothing clusters.} 
There has been work, however, on parallel model checking~\cite{parallelMurphi,distributed-spin,loadBalModelchecking,spin:multicore-modelchecking,modelCheckBDD}. The SPIN model checker has been parallelized two-way for dual-core machines~\cite{parallelSPIN}. Nevertheless, there are currently no model checkers that can scale to many loosely connected computers, mainly due to the overhead of coordinating the search across multiple machines and transferring explicit states. \cnine uses an encoding of states that is compact and enables better scaling.

\section{Symbolic Tests}

The general area of automated software testing has a rich body of published literature. We highlight here only the closest concepts. Symbolic tests are closely related to the idea of parameterized unit tests~\cite{tillmann-puts}. These extend regular unit tests with parameters marked as symbolic inputs during symbolic execution.
%
QuickCheck~\cite{quickcheck} allows writing specifications in Haskell, which again share their basic concept with symbolic tests, and tries to falsify them using random testing.  Symbolic execution can offer an alternative to random testing in evaluating QuickCheck test specifications.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{UNSORTED}

Closely related to symbolic execution is the concept of bounded model checking (BMC).  Instead of exploring individual execution paths and generate test cases, a BMC unfolds the control flow graph of the program and constructs a verification condition---a formula encompassing the behavior of the entire program with respect to a property to be checked.  Popular model checkers include CBMC~\cite{cbmc}, LLBMC~\cite{llbmc2012}, F-Soft~\cite{f-soft}, Magic~\cite{magic}, or Saturn~\cite{saturn}.

Beyond symbolic execution, there is substantial work done in the field of model checking and formal methods in general, which goes beyond the scope of this thesis.  We refer the interested reader to survey papers that cover the topic in more breadth~\cite{jhala2009software, woodcock2009formal}.
