In this chapter, we review the existing work that touches on the environment problem in symbolic execution.
%
We start with a brief overview of the symbolic execution engines that advanced the state of the art and made the technique applicable to real-world software (Section~\ref{sec:relwork:atcg}).
%
We then systematize the approaches these tools took to address the environment problem (Section~\ref{sec:relwork:envproblem}).
%
The last part of the chapter covers the use of symbolic execution for high-level languages, which is one particular focus of our work (Section~\ref{sec:relwork:interplang}).

\section{Summary}

Symbolic execution has been successfully used for finding bugs and generating high-coverage test suites.
%
The advancements in constraint solving and the approaches to the environment problem have been increasingly extending the reach of symbolic execution to larger and more complex real-world software.
%
Our work distinguishes itself as attaining a better tradeoff between the completeness of the environment provided to programs and the symbolic execution engine performance.

\section{UNSORTED}

Closely related to symbolic execution is the concept of bounded model checking (BMC).  Instead of exploring individual execution paths and generate test cases, a BMC unfolds the control flow graph of the program and constructs a verification condition---a formula encompassing the behavior of the entire program with respect to a property to be checked.  Popular model checkers include CBMC~\cite{cbmc}, LLBMC~\cite{llbmc2012}, F-Soft~\cite{f-soft}, Magic~\cite{magic}, or Saturn~\cite{saturn}.

Beyond symbolic execution, there is substantial work done in the field of model checking and formal methods in general, which goes beyond the scope of this thesis.  We refer the interested reader to survey papers that cover the topic in more breadth~\cite{jhala2009software, woodcock2009formal}.

Black-box (random) fuzzing.

Unsound approaches.

Cooperative symbolic execution (where the program uses special APIs of the engine).

%% \paragraph{DART}

%% DART automatically extracts the environment interface of a C program using static analysis.  DART augment the classic random fuzzing with a dynamic analysis that collects. The advantage of concrete execution is that DART can fall back on concrete semantics when symbolic ones are not supported (e.g., multiplications) DART detects standard errors such as crashes, assertion violations, and hangs.  Dart extracts the static interface of a program, consisting of global variables and inputs to the program entry function.  It concretizes calls to library functions.

%% Initializing values in DART: either randomly, or NULL or malloced values (for pointer types).  Chef and Cloud9 leaves it to the symbolic test the job of creating inputs. The basic primitives are marking allocated buffers (or integers or strings) as symbolic.
%% Dealing with environment inconsistencies in DART: Not a problem, as programs are re-executed (so no cross-talking in paths).  But assume no side effects in the program.
%% Solver in DART: lp\_solve (linear constraints of integers and reals).
%% DART was applied on C benchmarks and an implementation of the SIP protocol, finding hundreds of crashes.
%% DART uses DFS, BFS, or random.

%% \paragraph{CUTE}
%% Unit testing using concolic execution, with memory graphs as inputs.  Separates memory constraints from scalar constraints and keeps pointer constraints simple to keep the decision procedure tractable and efficient.
%% CUTE uses DFS.
%% CUTE uses its own in-house solver, built on top of lp\_solve, which adds optimizations such as incrementality.
%% CUTE supports generation of structured data by either calling sequences of operations, or solving data structure invariants (repOk operations), similar to Korat~\cite{boyapati:korat}.
%% Used for testing data structures.

%% \paragraph{EXE}
%% Dedicated constraint solver STP, codesigned with EXE, optimized for reasoning about bitvectors and arrays, which accurately encode machine operations at good performance.
%% Has a flat view of memory.
%% Works by translating the C code to an instrumented format that includes checks for concrete/symbolic values, forks (UNIX forks), and checks for properties (memory errors, division by zero).
%% Introduced constraint optimization: caching, constraint independence.
%% DFS/BFS as search heuristics.
%% Found bugs in udhcpd, packet filters (BPF), pcre regexp library.

%% \paragraph{SAGE}~\cite{sage2012,godefroid:fuzz}
%% Used in production, during Windows development, found thousands of vulnerabilities.  Largest known deployment of symbolic execution in production.
%% Targeted large applications, binary-level.
%% Introduces the generational search heuristic for finding bugs more efficiently in an incomplete search.

%% \paragraph{KLEE}
%% Uses symbolic execution for testing real-world systems code (Coreutils, Hi-star kernel, Busybox).  They built a high-performance symbolic execution engine that finds bugs in highly tested code and achieves high coverage levels.
%% Compact state representation using COW.
%% Uses a high-performance SMT solver (STP), and optimizes interface to the solver (constraint caching, expression simplifications).
%% Handles the environment problem through a model of files (used by the Coreutils), and external calls into the host environment.
%% Handles C code by compiling and running LLVM.
%% Uses static heuristics to maximize coverage, plus standard strategies.
%% Command line interface for marking inputs symbolic.

%% \paragraph{AEG}~\cite{aeg}
%% Automated testing with the specific purpose of generating proofs of vulnerabilities (exploits), i.e., inputs that explicitly hijack the program control flow and get a shell.
%% Takes as input LLVM + binary, produces exploit.
%% Generated 16 exploits on 14 open-source projects.
%% Buggy path-first heuristic: When a path has a bug (unexploitable), it is likely that it'll exhibit more bugs that could be exploitable.
%% Loop exhaustion strategy: prioritize paths exploring maximum number of iterations.
%% Symbolic files: simplifies KLEE's interface.
%% Symbolic sockets: supplies fresh symbolic data.
%% Environment variables (concrete values, fully symbolic, failures).
%% Network, multithreading, formatting functions (about 70 system calls).  Not clear how sound the support is, nor what happens when a syscall is not supported.

%% \paragraph{Mayhem}~\cite{mayhem}
%% Finds 29 exploitable vulnerabilities in Linux and Windows programs.
%% System designed to handle efficiently (at the expense of completeness) large state spaces generated by large programs.  Efficient reasoning about symbolic memory (symbolic writes are concretized, symbolic reads are replaced with nested ite expressions).
%% Uses only binaries (no debug info needed).

%% \paragraph{Bitblaze}~\cite{bitBlaze}
%% Unified binary analysis platform, used mainly for malware analysis.

%% \paragraph{Java Path Finder}
%% \cite{jpf-symbex,jpf-testgen,generalized-symbex}.
%% Code that manipulates complex data structures.  Uses lazy initialization to instantiate data structures.
%% Built on top of the JVM.
%% Uses iterative deepening combined with DFS.
%% Model checking as a form of testing: since the program environment is typically way too large, model checking ends up being testing.
%% Can be used to either execute a repOk method and generate blackbox inputs, or do whitebox testing.

%% \paragraph{Pex}
%% Pex~\cite{tillmann-pex}.
%% Whitebox fuzzing for .NET.  Integrated in Visual Studio.  Found errors in a core .NET component.
%% Uses PUTs (parameterized unit tests)~\cite{tillmann-puts}.
%% Uses a ``meta-strategy'' that groups branches in equivalence classes, and then selects the lest chosen class.  Different sets of equivalence classes are chosen uniformly.
%% Constructing objects: run symbolically the object constructor.

%% \paragraph{Others}

%% Other older test input generation tools: \cite{genptrinputs}.
