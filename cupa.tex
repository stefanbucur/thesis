\section{Overview}

\begin{itemize}
\item Rationale: Path explosion is clustered in fork bombs.
\item Idea: Isolate the fork bombs into groups selected uniformly for execution.  The intuition is that this will increase state diversity and hence increase the overall exploration throughput.
\item CUPA classes can be nested.
\end{itemize}
