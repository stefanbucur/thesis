In this chapter, we present our ongoing work on a cloud-based automated testing service for PaaS applications.
%
We first present the opportunities that computing clouds provide to developers, as well as the challenges developers face to test and secure their applications (Section~\ref{sec:paas:opportunity}).
%
We then give an overview of the usage of our PaaS-based testing service (Section~\ref{sec:paas:abstractions}).
%
The foundation of our service is a parallelization algorithm for symbolic execution that is the first to demonstrate linear scalability up to hundreds of cluster nodes (Section~\ref{sec:paas:parsymbex}).
%
On top, we introduce layered symbolic execution for addressing path explosion in systems composed of several stacked layers, such as protocol stacks (Section~\ref{sec:paas:layeredsymbex}).
%
Finally, we show how all pieces fit together in our S2E-based platform (Section~\ref{sec:paas:fedsymbex}).
