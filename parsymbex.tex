\section{Motivation}

\begin{itemize}
\item ``Throw hardware at the problem''.
\item No linear scalability demonstrated with previous approaches. Main cause: imbalanced tree shape, unknown a priori.
\item Foundation for a software testing service.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Overview}

\begin{itemize}
\item Introduce workers + load balancer.
\item Goal: disjoint and complete tree exploration.
\item Each worker explores tree independently, with minimal synchronization overhead.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Worker-level Operation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Introduce dead, fence, and candidate nodes.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Cluster-level Operation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Describe the load balancer operation.
\end{itemize}
